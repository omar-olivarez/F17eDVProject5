## What are we working on? An introduction to our project

This notebook will detail all the steps involved with visualizing data, including the Data Science pipeline. 

## What's this data? A description of the Expenditure Insurance dataset

The dataset used for all these examples is data regarding vehicle insurance expenditure, census data on how people get to work, vehicle registration numbers and general census data for each state in the United States.

Take a look at our Data model below to understand how the tables we're working with are linked together:
![datamodel](datamodel.png)

## Inputting the data and cleaning it 
Let's first import the dataset as a csv from the hard disk and clean the columns so that they are in integers and decimals rather than characters. Click on the 'Code' button to see that we used the 'read_csv' function to read the 'expenditure-insurance.csv' file from the hard disk of the user 'Carlos'.
```{r}
exp_ins = readr::read_csv("expenditure-insurance.csv", col_types = list(
  `Liability_2014` = col_number(),
  `Collision_2014` = col_number(),
  `Comprehensive_2014` = col_number(),
  `Average expenditure_2014` = col_number(),
  `Average expenditure_2013` = col_number(),
  `Average expenditure percent change 2013-2014` = col_number(),
  `2012` = col_number(),
  `2011` = col_number(),
  `2010` = col_number()
)) 
for(n in names(exp_ins)){
  exp_ins[n] = data.frame(lapply(exp_ins[n], gsub, pattern = '[^ -~]', replacement = ""))
}

readr::write_csv(exp_ins, "exp_ins_clean.csv")

# Read in and clean "vehiclereg-2013" data and export
reg2013 = readr::read_csv("vehiclereg-2013.csv")
for(n in names(reg2013)){
  reg2013[n] = data.frame(lapply(reg2013[n], gsub, pattern = '[^ -~]', replacement = ""))
}

readr::write_csv(reg2013, "reg2013_clean.csv")
 
# Read in and clean "vehiclereg-2014" data and export
reg2014 = readr::read_csv("vehiclereg-2014.csv")
for(n in names(reg2014)){
  reg2014[n] = data.frame(lapply(reg2014[n], gsub, pattern = '[^ -~]', replacement = ""))
}

readr::write_csv(reg2014, "reg2014_clean.csv")
```
Now the columns in the dataframe are either integers (for example: year) or strings (for example: state). Click on the 'Code' button above. You can see that our team exported the new file 'exp_ins_clean.csv' to the hard disk of the same user 'Carlos'. After this step, our team loaded the cleaned csv into data.world for the proceeding steps in the Data Science Pipeline process. 

## Importing cleaned data from data.world
Now let's use the data.world library to import the [Expenditure Insurance dataset](https://data.world/omarolivarez/f-17-edv-project-5/workspace/file?filename=exp_ins_clean.csv) from data.world: [THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT LINK]
```{r}
project <- "https://data.world/omarolivarez/f-17-edv-project-5"
data.world::set_config(cfg_env("DW_API"))
df <- data.world::query(data.world::qry_sql("SELECT * FROM exp_ins_clean"), dataset = project) %>% dplyr::select(1:12)
```
Let us take a look at the dataset's column names to see which visualizations work best for the data types:
```{r}
names(df)
```

## Total average expenditure by end of year 2014
Here we can see summed average expenditure of insurance by state and includes the whole of the USA and DC.
The bars in the graph are seperated by the years when the data was collected.

```{r}
expend = data.world::query(data.world::qry_sql("SELECT * FROM exp_ins_clean"), dataset = project)
g.expend = expend %>% tidyr::gather(year, expenditure, average_expenditure_2014, average_expenditure_2013,
                                    `2012`, `2011`, `2010`) %>%
  dplyr::select(state, year, expenditure)

renderPlot({
  g.expend %>% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = expenditure)) + geom_col(aes(fill = year)) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
})
```


## Average Expenditure by state (Bar Chart)
Here we can see graphs from four year of average expenditure per state and including DC and US average. 

```{r}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("selectYear", label = "Select Year", choices = c(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014), selected = 2010)
)

expend_by_state = data.world::query(data.world::qry_sql(
  "SELECT state, average_expenditure_2014, average_expenditure_2013, `2012`, `2011`, `2010`
  FROM exp_ins_clean"
), dataset = project)

bar_exp2010 = expend_by_state %>% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = `2010`)) + geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Expenditure in 2010", x = "State", y = "Average Expenditure") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

bar_exp2011 = expend_by_state %>% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = `2011`)) + geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Expenditure in 2011", x = "State", y = "Average Expenditure") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

bar_exp2012 = expend_by_state %>% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = `2012`)) + geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Expenditure in 2012", x = "State", y = "Average Expenditure") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

bar_exp2013 = expend_by_state %>% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = expend_by_state$average_expenditure_2013)) + geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Expenditure in 2013", x = "State", y = "Average Expendeture") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

bar_exp2014 = expend_by_state %>% ggplot(aes(x = state, y = expend_by_state$average_expenditure_2014)) + geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Expenditure in 2014", x = "State", y = "Average Expenditure") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

renderPlot({
  if(input$selectYear == 2010){
    bar_exp2010
  } else if(input$selectYear == 2011){
    bar_exp2011
  } else if(input$selectYear == 2012){
    bar_exp2012
  } else if(input$selectYear == 2013){
    bar_exp2013
  } else
    bar_exp2014
})
```

## Average total expenditure vs Total vehicles (Point graph)
Here we map total personal vehicles and the average expenditure for 8 states that at the end of 2014 had more than $5000 in expenditure
This grap only has end of year 2014 expenditure.

```{r}
transport = data.world::query(data.world::qry_sql(
  "with l1 as (select e.*, case
  when state = 'D.C.' then 'DC'
  when state = 'Delaware' then 'DE'
  when state = 'Florida' then 'FL'
  when state = 'Louisiana' then 'LA'
  when state = 'Michigan' then 'MI'
  when state = 'New Jersey' then 'NJ'
  when state = 'New York' then 'NY'
  when state = 'Rhode Island' then 'RI'
  else state
  end state_abr
  from exp_ins_clean e)
  
  select l1.average_expenditure_2014, l1.state_abr, de.b08006_002, de.b08006_016 from l1 join de d on l1.state_abr = d.state
  UNION
  select l1.average_expenditure_2014, l1.state_abr, la.b08006_002, la.b08006_016 from l1 join la l on l1.state_abr = l.state
  UNION
  select l1.average_expenditure_2014, l1.state_abr, fl.b08006_002, fl.b08006_016 from l1 join fl f on l1.state_abr = f.state

  UNION
  select l1.average_expenditure_2014, l1.state_abr, ny.b08006_002, ny.b08006_016 from l1 join ny y on l1.state_abr = y.state

# Select the specific rows that correspond to the whole
full_expend = transport %>% dplyr::mutate(total_trnspt = b08006_002 + b08006_016) %>% dplyr::group_by(average_expenditure_2014, state_abr) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(max_trnspt = max(total_trnspt))
renderPlot({
full_expend %>% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = average_expenditure_2014, y = max_trnspt, color = state_abr), size = 5) +
  labs(x = "Average Expenditure", y = "Total Personal Vehicles", title = "Avg expenditure vs Total Vehicles") + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
})
```

### Evaluating average expenditure based on number of collisions (in future, maybe per capita) 
Click on the 'Code' button below to see our code. First, we selected the columns for states' name, collisions in 2014, and average expenditures in 2014. 

We created a scatter plot of average expenditure and number of collisions in 2014, with each point representing the data for one state in the United States. Below we can see our findings.
**Notice the positive trend between the two variables. However, one interesting thing to note is that Oregon and California have similar average insurance expenditures in 2014, despite the fact that California had 72% more collisions than Oregon did in 2014. This is the largest discrepancy between any states with similar expenditure levels. We will examine this phenomena further**
*(The red points represent Oregon on the left and California on the right)*
```{r}
renderPlot({ 
  df2 <- df %>% dplyr::select(collision_2014, average_expenditure_2014, state) 
  g1 <- subset(df2, state == "Oregon")
  g2 <- subset(df2, state == "California")
  ggplot() + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=collision_2014,y= average_expenditure_2014), data = df2) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = collision_2014, y = average_expenditure_2014), colour="red", size=3, data=g1) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = collision_2014, y = average_expenditure_2014), colour="red", size=3, data=g2)
  })

myColors <- c("red4", "darkslategray3", "dodgerblue1", "darkcyan","gray79", "black", "skyblue2", "dodgerblue4","purple4", "maroon", "chocolate1", "bisque3", "bisque","seagreen4", "lightgreen", "skyblue4", "mediumpurple3","palevioletred1", "lightsalmon4", "darkgoldenrod1")

```

## Interesting Findings 
# Distribution of insurance per state
Here we can see the different amounts of money is spent depending on the type of insurance. 
We have data on three types of insurance: Liability, Collision, and Comprehensive. 

```{r}
inputPanel(
  sliderInput("lowBound", label = "Lower Bound:", min = 500, max = 900, value = 500, step = 20),
  sliderInput("highBound", label = "Higher Bound", min = 800, max = 1200, value = 800, step = 20)
)

df = data.world::query(data.world::qry_sql(
  "with e1 as (select state, average_expenditure_2014, liability_2014, collision_2014, comprehensive_2014 from exp_ins_clean)
  
  select e1.state, e1.average_expenditure_2014, e1.liability_2014, e1.collision_2014, e1.comprehensive_2014, usa_all_states.b08006_002 as tot_cars, usa_all_states.b08006_016 as tot_moto from e1 join usa_all_states u on e1.state =u.areaname"
), dataset = project)

renderTable(
  df %>% dplyr::filter(between(average_expenditure_2014, input$lowBound, input$highBound)) %>% dplyr::mutate(tot_vehivles = tot_cars + tot_moto)
)

renderPlot({
  df %>% dplyr::filter(between(average_expenditure_2014, input$lowBound, input$highBound)) %>%
    tidyr::gather(key = "ins_type", value = "amount", liability_2014:comprehensive_2014) %>%
    ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = state, y = amount, fill = ins_type)) +
    labs(title =  "Expenditure by insurenace type", x = "State", y = "Expenditure in $") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
})

```

# Changes in expenditure in the states with highest expenditure
Here we can see the change in expenditure in the states that had more than $5000 in average insurance expenditure by the end of the 2014.

```{r}
delta_expend = expend %>% tidyr::gather(year, expenditure, average_expenditure_2014, average_expenditure_2013,
                                        `2012`, `2011`, `2010`) %>%
  dplyr::select(state, year, expenditure)

delta_expend$year = sub("^.*2014$", "2014", delta_expend$year)
delta_expend$year = sub("^.*2013$", "2013", delta_expend$year)
delta_expend$year = as.numeric(as.character(delta_expend$year))

# Get seperate datasets for each state we are interested in
# DC data
delta_dc = delta_expend %>% 
  dplyr::filter(state == "D.C.") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lead_exp = expenditure - lead(expenditure))
  
# Delaware data
delta_de = delta_expend %>%
  dplyr::filter(state == "Delaware") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lead_exp = expenditure - lead(expenditure))

# Florida data
delta_fl = delta_expend %>%
  dplyr::filter(state == "Florida") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lead_exp = expenditure - lead(expenditure))

# Louisiana data
delta_la = delta_expend %>%
  dplyr::filter(state == "Louisiana") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lead_exp = expenditure - lead(expenditure))

# Michigan data
delta_mi = delta_expend %>%
  dplyr::filter(state == "Michigan") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lead_exp = expenditure - lead(expenditure))

# New Jersey data
delta_nj = delta_expend %>%
  dplyr::filter(state == "New Jersey") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lead_exp = expenditure - lead(expenditure))

# New York data
delta_ny = delta_expend %>%
  dplyr::filter(state == "New York") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lead_exp = expenditure - lead(expenditure))

# Rhode Island data
delta_ri = delta_expend %>%
  dplyr::filter(state == "Rhode Island") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lead_exp = expenditure - lead(expenditure))

renderPlot({
line_expend = ggplot(data = delta_dc, aes(x = year, y = lead_exp, color = state)) + geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_line(data = delta_de, size = 1) + geom_line(data = delta_fl, size = 1) + geom_line(data = delta_la, size = 1) +
  geom_line(data = delta_mi, size = 1) + geom_line(data = delta_nj, size = 1) + geom_line(data = delta_ny, size = 1) +
  geom_line(data = delta_ri, size = 1) + ylab("Delta Expenditure")
})
```

Michigan and Louisiana have had constant growth in the last 4 years that the data has been collected, with Michigan having the highest growth rate. Also we see that even if Florida has one of the highest insurance expenditure, we see that it has stedily decreased in the past four years.
